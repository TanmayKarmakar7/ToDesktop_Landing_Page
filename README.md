# ToDesktop Landing Page

The ToDesktop Landing Page clone is a pixel-perfect replica of the original desktop app packaging service site, constructed using HTML for semantic structure, 
Tailwind CSS enables efficient styling and responsive design, and JavaScript for added functionality. The clone replicates key elements like the hero banner, interactive buttons, and smooth transitions. 
Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach makes customization fast and flexible, while JavaScript powers dynamic features, and delivering an engaging user experience on any device.
